            In web design and development, I found the perfect outlet to utilize
            my attention to small details as well as my interest in being part
            of a team creating and developing clean and sophisticated code
            behind beautiful sites. I am fascinated with the speed technology
            changes; I am connected vias blogs & social media and yet I donâ€™t
            feel too obsessed to be plugged in ALL the time. I enjoy both
            working on site and off, and love the flexibility and challenges of
            a career constantly moving.

            With a background including a career as a baker and an architectural
            photographer, I have always had a passion for design and an
            attention to details, no matter how small. Born in Pomona, CA, I
            slowly moved north over the years, attracted to the wilderness,
            fresh air and city life. When I am not knee deep in code, I can be
            found hiking, camping, appreciating some local mirco brews or
            getting my passport stamped by a gruff looking guard who speaks
            little English. I enjoy music, films, and photography as well as
            just relaxing and watching the game.
